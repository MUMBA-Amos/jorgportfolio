                  I'm Jorg â€“ a pragmatic leader, problem-solver, and someone who believes that work should have meaning beyond metrics. 
                  I've spent the last 15+ years leading teams and driving change across Africa, Asia, and Europe in industries ranging 
                  from digital media to solar energy, logistics, and consulting.
                </p>
                <p className="about-description">
                  I currently serve as General Manager at Sam Media in Kuala Lumpur, where I lead a diverse and talented team delivering 
                  digital products to millions of users worldwide. Before this, I helped scale solar companies in Zambia and Senegal, 
                  overhauled management structures in a Zambian retail giant, and gained experience in business consultancy and project 
                  management in West-Europe.

                <p className="about-description">
                  Colleagues often describe me as direct but empathetic. I'm not one to dance around issues. I believe in honesty, 
                  clarity, integrity, and creating environments where people feel safe to contribute, experiment, and grow. Creating 
                  'Psychological Safety' in companies and teams is one of my top priorities!
